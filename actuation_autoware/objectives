**MAIN OBJECTIVES**

- **Message conversion** or compilation into idlc
- Switching **threading** mechanism to pthread instead of rcl thread of ROS2
- Use zephyr **logging** mechanism instead of plain printf or ROS logger
- **Configuration** file reader instead of inline configuration within the code itself
- Introduce **message queue** within the actuation service

**GOOD TO HAVES**

- Using **IPC** instead of DDS inside actuation
- Getting rid of **unnecessary dependencies** of autoware packages

**NOTES**

- **Eigen** seems working but needs to be verified
